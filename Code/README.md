# README

This directory contains four R files:

1. plot1.R - Produces Rplot1.png
2. plot2.R - Produces Rplot2.png
3. plot3.R - Produces Rplot3.png
4. plot4.R - Produces Rplot4.png

These files produce the plots that are contained in the "Plots" directory. All of these R files read in a text file named "household_power_consumption.txt" that is assumed to be in your current working directory. The "household_power_consumption.txt" file contains the data that is used to produce the plots. This file can be obtained from the following link: [Household Power Consumption.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip). All the graphics that are produced by these scripts are saved to your current working directory.
