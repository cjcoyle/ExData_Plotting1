This directory contains four PNG files:

1. Rplot1.png - A histogram of Global Active Power (in kilowatts).
2. Rplot2.png - A line graph of Global Active Power (in kilowatts) between 2/1/2007 and 2/2/2007.
3. Rplot3.png - A line graph of energy consumption (in watt-hours of active energy) of the kitchen (Sub_metering_1), laundry room (Sub_metering_2), and water-heater/air-conditioner (Sub_metering_3) between 2/1/2007 and 2/2/2007.
4. Rplot4.png - A combination of four different charts (clockwise from upper-left):
	+ A line graph of Global Active Power between 2/1/2007 and 2/2/2007
	+ A line graph of Voltage between 2/1/2007 and 2/2/2007
	+ A line graph of Global Reactive Power between 2/1/2007 and 2/2/2007
	+ A line graph of energy consumption (in watt-hours of active energy) of the kitchen (Sub_metering_1), laundry room (Sub_metering_2), and water-heater/air-conditioner (Sub_metering_3) between 2/1/2007 and 2/2/2007.

All of these plots are created from corresponding R files that are contained in the "Code" directory.
